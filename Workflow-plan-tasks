Workflow Breakdown and Task Ordering

File Upload to Blob Storage
Implement a function to handle file uploads from the website to Azure Blob Storage. This ensures that uploaded files are securely stored and accessible to your modeler and other processes.

File Visibility and Processing in the Modeler
Ensure the modeler can access and process files stored in Blob Storage. Depending on how your modeler is built, this might involve setting up appropriate permissions and using Azure Blob Storage SDKs to retrieve files.

Sending Processed File to Printful
After processing, use an Azure Function to upload the finished file from Blob Storage to Printful. This requires adjusting the uploadFileToPrintful function to handle multipart/form-data correctly and securely passing Printful API keys.

Creating Product and Generating Mockups in Printful
Implement or extend Azure Functions to interact with Printful's API for product creation using the uploaded file. After creating the product, use Printful's API to generate mockups.

Retrieving and Storing Mockups in Blob Storage
After a short delay (e.g., 10 seconds as you suggested), download mockup images from Printful and store them in Azure Blob Storage for website access. This likely involves an Azure Function that polls Printful for mockup readiness, downloads the mockups, and stores them in Blob Storage.

Displaying Mockups on the Website
Develop a method to dynamically update the website with links to the stored mockup images in Blob Storage. This might involve API calls from your website to Azure to retrieve the storage URLs.

Shopify Product Creation and Storefront Update
Once a product is finalized and approved, trigger Azure Functions to initiate Printful APIs for finalizing the product and pushing it to the Shopify storefront. This involves product creation in Shopify via API calls and retrieving the product page URL.

Redirecting to the Newly Created Shopify Product Page
After the product is available on Shopify, your website needs to redirect users to the new product page. This could be achieved through an Azure Function that communicates the new product page URL back to your website.

Implementation Steps and Technologies

Azure Functions: The backbone of your serverless architecture, handling API interactions, file processing, and orchestrating the workflow.

Azure Blob Storage: Stores uploaded files, processed models, and mockups. Ensure proper access management.

API Management: Securely manage API keys and endpoints for Printful and Shopify using Azure Key Vault and environment variables in your Azure Functions.

Webhooks/Event Grid: Consider using Azure Event Grid or Webhooks for more efficient event-driven architecture, especially for status updates from Printful or Shopify.

Frontend Integration: Ensure your website can dynamically interact with Azure Functions to display mockups and redirect to Shopify. This might involve JavaScript Fetch API or Axios for asynchronous HTTP requests.

Security and Best Practices

Secure Storage of Sensitive Information: Use Azure Key Vault for API keys and sensitive information.
Monitoring and Logging: Utilize Azure Monitor and Application Insights for monitoring your functions' performance and troubleshooting.
CORS Configuration: Configure CORS in your Azure Functions app to allow your website to make cross-origin requests safely.

By following these outlined steps and leveraging Azure's serverless and storage capabilities, you can systematically achieve your desired workflow for the t-shirt modeler integration with Printful and Shopify. Each of these tasks will require careful planning, implementation, and testing to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.
