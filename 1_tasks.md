1. Setup Azure Blob Storage
Create a Blob Storage Account: In the Azure portal, create a new Blob Storage account if you haven't already. Note the account name and key; you'll need these to access the storage from your function.
Create a Container: Within your Blob Storage account, create a container where uploaded files will be stored.
2. Develop the Azure Function
Initialize a New Function App: If you don't have an existing Function App, create one in the Azure portal or via the Azure CLI. This app will host your file upload function.
Create a New Function: Within your Function App, create a new function triggered by HTTP requests. This function will receive file uploads from your website.
3. Implement File Upload Logic
Here's a simplified example of what the function's code might look like, using Node.js:

//code strts
const { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');
const multipart = require('parse-multipart');

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING);
    const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient('your-container-name');

    // Parse the multipart/form-data request
    const bodyBuffer = Buffer.from(req.body);
    const boundary = multipart.getBoundary(req.headers['content-type']);
    const parts = multipart.Parse(bodyBuffer, boundary);

    // Assume the first part is the file to upload
    const file = parts[0];
    const blobName = file.filename;
    const blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(blobName);

    try {
        // Upload the file to Blob Storage
        await blockBlobClient.upload(file.data, file.data.length);
        context.res = { status: 200, body: 'File uploaded successfully.' };
    } catch (error) {
        context.res = { status: 500, body: `Error uploading file: ${error.message}` };
    }
};
// code ends
4. Configure Environment Variables
Set the AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING environment variable in your Function App settings to securely store the connection string to your Blob Storage account.
5. Testing and Deployment
Local Testing: If you're using the Azure Functions Core Tools, you can run and test your function locally before deploying it to Azure.
Deploy Your Function: Deploy your function to Azure either through the Azure portal, VS Code, or the Azure CLI.
Frontend Integration: Adjust your website's upload feature to direct file uploads to the newly created Azure Function endpoint. Ensure CORS settings in your Function App allow requests from your website.
6. Security Considerations
Access Control: Consider using Azure Managed Identities for more secure access to Blob Storage from your Azure Function, rather than storing and using connection strings directly.
Validate Inputs: Always validate file types and sizes on both the client and server sides to prevent unwanted uploads.
